##Exercisis 3

Files implementing the algorithms and datastructurs are:

main.c - only executing functions in other Files 
test.c and test.h - contains the functions ran from main.c connected with test.h

insertionsort.h and inserionsort_func.c - include funtions for insertion sort connected to test.c with headerfile.
mergesort.h and mergesort_func.c - same as insertion sort for merge sort.

The testing includes a clock timer for claculation execution time for each sorting algorithm with given  array.
We also give a visual reprensentation for comparing the arrays.

You can test my function by updateting the varibels at the top of the test.c file.
I've included comments about what does what. You need to provide 3 files genereated with my varaion of the python script.
So that there is a backwards file (solution array in backwards ordering).

QUESTIONS, I answear based on 100 000 ints in a array
• The input array is sorted in descending order: Merge sort
• The input array is sorted in ascending order: Insertion sort
• All elements in the array are the same: Insertion sort
• There are both positive and negative numbers in the array: Merge sort
