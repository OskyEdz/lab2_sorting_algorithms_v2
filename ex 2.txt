##Exercisis 2

Files implementing the algorithms and datastructurs are:

main.c - only executing functions in other Files 
test.c and test.h - contains the functions ran from main.c connected with test.h

mergesort.h and mergesort_func.c - same as insertion sort for merge sort.

The testing includes a clock timer for claculation execution time for each sorting algorithm with given  array.
We also give a visual reprensentation for comparing the arrays.

You can test my function by updateting the varibels at the top of the test.c file.
I've included comments about what does what. You need to provide 3 files genereated with my varaion of the python script.
So that there is a backwards file (solution array in backwards ordering).
